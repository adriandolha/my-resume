# My Resume

My resume is a simple mui app intended to create professional resume. I wanted to create a resume online, and I started 
looking at options, but all of them lured you into registering only to discover after that you need to make a monthly
subscription in order to get a hold on you resume. In the end I decided to give it a try with MUI and some libraries to 
read yaml and generate PDF. Plus, it should be fun.
